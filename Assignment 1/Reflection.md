# Reflections ðŸŒ 

## What I have gained ðŸ“š
This talk really blows up my mind on large scope of ICT jobs such as Android developer, UI/UX designer and Web/API developer. Those are new to me which they explain about how their daily schedule, the commitments and skills needed. Besides, it's my first time hear about Clarity Techworks which is quite wonderful on its jobscope and achievements. Through the talk, they also mentioned about what applications they use (i.e. Slack, Figma and Sourcetree).
## Improvements ðŸ’¡
I think what can be improve is how this talk is been delivered. It is more fun if students can go visit the industry or having physically industry talk. Moreover, UTM can organize this company's booth so that student will love to come get to know more about technologies.
## Others 
In my point of view, this talk really open up my observation in computing and technology sector. This gives me hope and brighter future plans. I hope one day I will get to work in that industry.
