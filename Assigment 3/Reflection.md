## What I gained ðŸ“š
Through participating in discussions within the system development industry, I foresee encountering challenges over the next four years as system developer. I realize the important of staying updated on the latest advancements in this field. This is for making a positive impression on my ideal company in the future. I also am impress on how Ms. Qistina manage to get through those hard challenges by using 5 steps that is being introduced which is planning, analysis, design, implementation and maintenance. This approach had give me the best confidence and desire in being better in my course.
## Improvements ðŸ’¡
Improvements that can be made is being punctual as the talk was delayed for almost an hour. Besides, going for industry visit might be great also.

We ought to organise for an industry visit as well, to get more information about the degrees we are now pursuing.
