# Reflections ðŸŒ 

## What I have gained ðŸ“š
It's so great to see how UTM systems and employees operate together, how they manage to solve problems occured step by step and how big their office is. UTM Digital also provide the best facilities that create relaxing and comfortable space for meeting and discussion. Moreover, I get to know which places are prohibited by civilain for instance, data centre. There is restricted and we even need to put our phone outside from there for privacy purpose.
## Improvements ðŸ’¡
Actually, it is nice if we can have more time in there and explore more about employee's time management, and how they brainstorm ideas to solve the problem.
## Others 
It was incredibly thrilling to see the data centre because of how secretive it is and since we are the first year to be granted access, which shows that they want us to see how they really operate to enhance the systems and provide us with the greatest experience possible.
