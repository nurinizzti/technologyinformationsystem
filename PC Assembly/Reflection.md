## What I have gained ðŸ“š
I get to gain new experience with assembling the pc. It really helps me to know how to handle those component well (i.e. we are adviced to not hold the RAM's part as it is very sensitive). We also are allowed to touch and pull out components which helps me to remember each component's name. 
## Improvements ðŸ’¡
From my perspective, I believe we can reduce the group size such that each member can manage this independently. Besides, maybe a video on pc assembly can be given first to students before the session starts.
## Others
I'm having a great time interacting with the computer. It's intriguing to learn about the incredible functions that each tiny part can do despite its diminutive size.
