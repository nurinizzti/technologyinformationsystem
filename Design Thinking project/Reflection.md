# Reflections ðŸŒ 

## What I have gained ðŸ“š
Now, I know how to work in a team, provide ideas and solutions, and design the best product. I also learned how to use Canva to design our prototype nice and neatly. Besides, I found out that research and interviewing really help much in creating the best ergonomic solutions. I also get to explore more in navigation technology, make it more useful and improve my skills in writing report.
## Improvements ðŸ’¡
I don't really think there are lack anywhere through this project but I hope that I can be more exposed to example project that have been made by past students so that we can improve better the functions.
## Others
I am very satisfied in working with my team as they respond to my chat quickly and are glad to help me with problems we faced. I also get to comunicate with them well both in Malay and English language.
